SNHU Project

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project required me to collaborate with Airgead Banking, creating an program that will teach local high school students the concepts of discal responsibility. The initial focus for this project was on investing and the power of compound interest. My directions were to review the functional requirements and develop an object-oriented programming(OOP) application using secure and efficient C++ code.

# What did you do particularly well?

I feel as if I did well with giving the end user the correct results with the proper input

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Given inproper inputs, the program exits rather than informing the user that their input is invalid which isn't too user friendly

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I find it challenging to write neat output to display towards the user, especially when everything is showing on the command line

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I feel as if the construction of the alogorithms and logic are easily transferable skills from this project

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I followed best practices and ethical coding guidelines
